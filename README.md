# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads project from the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Installation

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## App Functionality

There are two pages in the app: the Home page and the Search page. You are able to navigate back and forth by clicking the corresponding links.

* Home page: There are three shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read), each with different books. You can move each book from one shelf to another.
* Search page: You can use the text input at the top to find books. As the value of the text input changes the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library. Once you navigate back to the Home page, it will reflect any changes you made from the Search page.
